Welcome to your ~~Node.js project~~ Kuali ResDemo1 Automated Testing (Node.js/NightmareJS) project using the Cloud9 IDE (and servers)!

Here are instructions for runing the program (example is the award module):

## Running the automated test program/script

1) Open `resdemo1-example.js` (from the left hand menu) and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu. You might need to try running it once to get the tab at the bottom, but you'll need to make sure the "resdemo1-example" tab at the bottom of the screen, is set with "Runner: xvfb_node" on the right hand side of that bottom tab (you'd have to select it from the dropdown list)

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Linux Terminal (bash tab at the bottom):

    $ xvfb-run node resdemo1-example.js

Once it's runing, you should see a folder created underneath the "screenshots" folder on the left hand list of files/folders with todays date and time. Inside that you should see screenshots start to appear as it runs through the automated test/automatically does stuff




~~Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.~~
